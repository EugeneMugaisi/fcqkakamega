                <h3>20TH MARCH 2022</h3>
                <h3>THEME: Restoration of our SALVATION</h3>
                <h3>TEXT: PSALMS 51:12</h3>
                <h3>SPEAKER: PASTOR JOSEPH SHAMALA (G.S KYM)</h3>
                <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
                <p>Our theme for this year is “CELEBRATING THE YEAR OF GOD’S RESTORATION”</p>
                <p>It is derived from Jeremiah 30:17 and Joel 2:25-26. We shall be seeing more of these verse two scriptures as we bring you the word of God this year.</p>
                <p>This theme is about you and me that we can humble before the Lord and ask him to restore us to the position we were in in before the issues we faced.</p>
                <p>God is so faithful to us friends that when we genuinely and without conditions can cry to him, he will forgive us. He will restore us to where he want his children to be.</p>
                <p>RESTORATION comes when people see their sins and are ready to humble themselves and seek the face of God. </p>
                <p>Psalm 51 which is said to be a Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet went to him after he had gone in to Bathsheba. </p>
                <p>The commentary to this Psalm is entitled RESTORATION OF A BROKEN AND CONTRITE KING. He says in verse 12...restore to me the Joy of my salvation.</p>
                <p>I think since we are all Christians and we are saved by the blood, the many things we have done is a point we need to turn to God for forgiveness. The psalm of David reveals to us that we were born in iniquity and we are sinful every day of our lives.</p>
                <p>We need God to restore our salvation. The Salvation we enjoyed in him without our sins. </p>
                <p>Brethren, remember that David was living a normal life after he had murdered. Just imagine murdering somebody’s husband because of the lust of seeing his wife naked. He continued to live as if nothing had happened. Daily chores were being done by this man yet somebody is in the grave.</p>
                <p>Friends do you know that we continue to do things like David? </p>
                <p>How many people have we continued to kill by the kinds of words we say, by the kinds of actions we carry out, by the kind of look we display.
                    We kill like David and behave nothing has happened.
                    We need to ask the Lord to forgive us and restore our salvation.
                    David was a servant of God. After this Psalm he is said to be a man after God’s own heart.
                </p>
                <p>As we go through our theme for this year, may I ask that God touches each one of us to re-examine our relationship with him. Are we still enjoying the salvation he gave to us? Are our actions my dear brothers and sisters showing saved people? Are we behaving well as sons and daughter of God?</p>
                <p>God is so faithful that by his mercies, by his grace he is ready to forgive us and get us to our place in his kingdom
                    Sin comes into our lives because of human nature. These are our characters and responses. Most of the time we usually react wrongly.</p>
                <p>
                    We want to revenge
                    We want to lie
                    We want to take sides
                    We want to fight
                    We want to steal
                    We want to be the people in position
                    We end up killing
                </p>
                <h3>SALVATION OR BEING SAVED DOES THE FOLLOWING</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.	Saves us from the power of sin- Paul said in 2Cor 5:17 if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation, the old has gone behold the new has come.</li>
                    <li>2.	Saves us from the consequences of sin. Not forgiving and being too bitter-you bring ulcers, pressure which will affect your life. Live free, live with a lot of repentance.</li>
                    <li>3.	Effects of Salvation-</li>
                </ul>
                <p>May the Lord of grace look down to us to forgive us our sins and make us to be the kinds of people he wants us to be.
                    May he restore each one of us in salvation and if there is somebody here who has never received his salvation, may you get it from God.
                </p>
                <p>AMEN!</p>
