                <h3>5TH DECEMBER 2021</h3>
                <h3>THEME: CONSIDER YOUR ACTIONS NOW OR ELSE THEY WILL AFFECT YOUR CHILDREN</h3>
                <h3>TEXT: 2 SAMUEL 17:1-14</h3>
                <h3>CASE STUDY: ABSALOM AND DAVID</h3>
                <h3>SPEAKER: PASTOR PATRICK ILOLO</h3>
                <p>A father’s mistakes are often reflected in the lives of his children.<br></p>
                    <b>Introduction</b><br>
                    <p>We must consider what we do today at home, work place and in our ministry in the church.
                    These things will affect our children in future. <br>
                    As much as our children are under our care, we must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <b><li>Train them in a way they should go.</li>
                        <li>Discipline them when they go wrong.</li>
                        <li>Rebuke them when they indulge in bad practices.</li>
                        <li>Direct them the way to go.</li>
                        <li>Correct them when they are immoral.</li></b>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is what we must do as fathers to our children.
                    Absalom was the son of David.
                    He was born handsome.
                    He was as charismatic just like the father David.
                    He comforted his sister Tamar when she was raped by Amnon, the half-brother. She allowed her to stay with him.
                    He revenged the action of his half-brother Anmon by killing him.
                    He also plotted against his father to take away his throne. <b>2nd Samuel 15:9-12.</b>
                    He constantly listened to wrong advice from his advisors.
                    <b>2nd Samuel 16:20-22</b></p><br>
                    <h3>LESSON TO LEARN</h3>
                    <p>As a church, we must understand that the sins of parents are often repeated and amplified in the lives of their 
                        children.David was warned about the actions of his son Amnon, but did not take it seriously. The sin of Uriah and
                        Bethsheba affected the children of David and his household.</p><br>
                    <h3>NOTES</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Absalom was David’s son. The sins that his father David did with Uriah affected his family at large.</li>
                        <li>God had predicted that David’s family will suffer because of his sins.</li>
                        <li>David’s heart was broken as he realized that God’s prediction was coming to be true.</li>
                        <li>God forgave David, but he did not cancel the consequences of his sins.</li>
                        <li>Absalom was a good man who could make a good leader or king. People loved him. The problem with Absalom was that he lacked the inner character and control that is required of a leader.</li>
                        <li>His appearance, skills, positions did not measure up his integrity because Absalom kept sinning. He also relied on his advisors who gave him wrong advice. David had prayed that his advisor Ahiphothel should give Absalom FOOLISH advice <b>Samuel 15:31.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>QUESTION</b> - HOW MANY TIMES as a church have we missed to enter into God’s love through the door of forgiveness and repentance? As father’s parents and a church. We must repent our sins, train our children by correcting them so as to save pour coming generation. If you fear disciplining your child now, he will discipline you tomorrow.
                    </p>
                    <h3> 5-FIVE POINTS TO REMEMBER </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The enemy will always attack you when you are weak, weary and discouraged</b><P>Don’t allow anybody to discourage you from praying, reading the Word of God, and fasting. These are times when your church will discourage your prayer life, ministry, preaching and worship.</P></li>
                        <li><b>Psalms 55:9-15- Your greatest enemy is that person who was your great friend.</b><p>Note: The insults and plots of an enemy can be endured, but those of your treasured friend are hard. How could Absalom plan to overturn the father?In our daily lives, the problems we encounter in our areas of operation just come from within ourselves.If I am not a praise and worship team member, I cannot kill and destroy the ministry of the praise and worship. They themselves are accountable for their problems.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Those people you call friend are your closest enemies.</b><p>Watch those advisors, those whom you call daddy, mummy, my spiritual father. They are the same people who will expose you from where you are hiding. They will expose your hiding caves and rocks.</p></li>
                        <li><b>The devil will crown you with false authority and power.</b><p>It is the work of the enemy to give you pride and crown you with counterfeit authority so that in a short time, he might short change your leadership. Absalom was crowned in Hebron. – 2nd Samuel 15:10.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Don’t take power through flattery, corrupt means</b><p>or by sword because the same way you get power, position and authority is the same way it will be taken from you 2 Sam: 15-7-10.Absalom took power through flattery but you can see what happened to him.David did not consider the discipline of his children but at last the same children plotted to overthrow him.Today, the advisors you listen to are the same enemies who will throw you down on the ground.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>What we do now in church will eventually have a big impact to our children upto the fourth generation. <br>AMEN!</p>
