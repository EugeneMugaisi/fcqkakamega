                <h2>SUNDAY SERVICE</h2>
                <h3>12TH DECEMBER 2021</h3>
                <h3>THEME: GOD NEVER CHANGES</h3>
                <h3>TEXT: HEBREWS 13:7-10</h3>
                <h3>SPEAKER: PASTOR JOSEPH SHAMALA (G.S KYM)</h3>
                <p>The love of God-is so amazing; We serve a God who never changes. The God we serve, the God I know, the God of Abraham;Jacob; Isaac: The God of our forefathers who believed in God- The God of the founders of this church-who were so passionate in their belief that they carried on this good news to us.</p><br>
                <p>That God dear brothers and sisters is one who remains the same and he will never change. We should be excited to know that we serve a God who cannot change despite our changing love and knowledge of him. He remains the same. That is why the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8-Jesus Christ  is the same yesterday and today and forever-The God who was there when the world was being created is the same God we worship today, he is the same God we are going to meet and stay with him forever. If you are here and think that God has changed, take it from me that he has remained the same throughout eternity. If you think that God is old as some antichrist are putting it, know that he never changes.</p><br>
                <p><b>Three things to show that God never Changes</b></p><br>
                <ul>
                    <p>His unchanging word:</p>
                    <li><b>1. God’s word will never change.</b></li>
                    <p>That is why it is important for us to have His word with us. Memorise His word and have it on our lips. The word will be your shield in every situation of life. It was used by Jesus himself during his temptation by the evil on. It will be your protection at any temptation.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Matthew 24: 35 says ‘Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.” 1Peter 1:25 says “But the word of God endures forever”</b></p><br>
                    <p>I Beseech you as members of this church to believe in God’s word which will remain forever.To join to this,  be reminded that we are a main stream missionary church. We believe in the hymns as authentic words written by people who were led and most of them have biblical backing and therefore we should not neglect the act of singing the hymns as part of the unchanging  word of God. Why depend on God’s word? It has promises for us. Those promises come to happen in our lives.</p>
                    <li><b>2. The other thing about our God that never changes is his love to us.</b></li>
                    <p><b>Psalm 100:5 “For the Lord is Good and his love endures forever.”</b> God loves for us cannot be compared to the love that mankind has.</p><br>
                    <p>Your friend will change their love, Your spouse will change, Your brothers will change, But one thing about God is that He never changes. God loves you with the love that we cannot describe.</p><br>
                    <p>If it was the will of man you could have come this far. He says that he encompasses us with his wings. He surrounds us with His love.</p>
                    <li><b>3. The last thing  about a God who never changes is that our God never changes his plans for us.</b></li><br>
                    <p>As human beings we will change our plans according to the circumstances-We will change not to attend church because our children or a visitor has come home. We will change not to attend Kitongoji because it is not appealing to you, We will change this and that BUT God’s plans for our lives never changes, What he has said will happen TO YOU…IN THIS LIFE IT MAY NOT BE TODAY OR TOMORROW OR NEXT MONTH but it will happen.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Psalm 33:11 "But the plans of the LORD stand firm forever, the purposes  of his heart through all generations.”</b></p><br>
                    <p><b>Jeremiah 29: 11 “For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, Plans to prosper you and not harm you, plans to give you hope and future.”</b></p><br>
                    <p>Friends- God never changes his plans for you <br> Don’t give up and say that I don’t have- I can’t commit…He will fulfil what He has for you. <br> A family who has no hope- God has plans for you- Not to harm you but to prosper you.</p>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Let us cling on God who never changes <br> Let us have faith in our God who is everything to us.</p>
