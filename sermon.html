                <h3>30TH JANUARY 2022</h3>
                <h3>THEME: PURPOSEFUL AND IMPACTFUL LIVING</h3>
                <h3>TEXT: LUKE 14:25-35</h3>
                <h3>SPEAKER: PASTOR JOSEPH SHAMALA (G.S KYM)</h3>
                <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
                <p>Christianity is about the call to follow Christ and to totally surrender to him. 
                    You have to seek him and when you find Him, He is ready to help you to live a victorious life. 
                    A life with a purpose from the very beginning despite the struggles and temptations. 
                    A life of sacrifices and perseverance, a total surrender and not looking back.
                    A life of rest from the worldly pressures and pleasures. A life of counting the cost.
                </p>
                <p>Brethren, we are in church not because of what we get here but because of fellowship and encouraging each other to holy living. This life has a cost.</p>
                <p>We are here for a purpose. Time is so short. Live purposeful lives. Do not just live anyhow.</p>
                <p>In Luke 14:25-35- Jesus is just reminding His disciples of the cost of following him. It is costly and not just a joke. 
                    Brethren, there is nothing for free. Even you attending a service is a cost.
                </p>
                <p>Remember what the disciples told Jesus. We have left everything to follow you. In Luke 18:28-Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you” Truly I tell you, Jesus said to them no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and in the age to come eternal life.</p>
                <p>Today, I prophesy to you that you are here for a purpose and therefore since you have left so much for the kingdom of God, there are blessings in this age and the age to come.</p>
                <p>Leaders, you are not doing any work in vain. God has said that you will receive many times in this age. Men, women, Young people in the church who have always sacrificed your money, your time for worship, you never tire up for repeated giving. You are going to receive many things that God has promised you this year. Your labour is not in vain. AMEN.</p>
                <p>Jesus summarizes by saying this in verse 33, “In the same way any of you who does not give up everything he has, cannot be my disciple.”</p>
                <p>Brethren, this world is about people struggling with material things. What do we gain? but they have forgotten the most important thing—serving God.</p>
                <p>We are not impactful as Christians because we have not fully surrendered our lives fully to Christ.
                    Live fully serving the Lord. When you have employment, serve GOD with your employment. When you have talent, serve God with that talent. Do not wait to retire so that you can go to Bible College to serve God.
                </p>
                <p>Do not take your life focused on the temporal and forget what is eternal. Don’t take time focusing on the material possessions and forgetting the Spiritual. When we do this, we will be living purposeful lives.</p>
                <p>Contextualize the story of Naaman and Prophet Elisha. When Naaman was sick and was told about how to be healed, he rebuked the idea of washing in the river. It took the master’s slave to change his min.</p>
                <p>He made an impact in the life of the king. Yet he was just a small person! What are doing with your smallness?</p>
                <p>Each one of us has to make an impact in the church.
                    We have to look for souls to make the church great. We have to leave petty issues of fighting, backbiting, rumour carrying e.t.c.
                </p>
                <p>We live once in this World and therefore we need to do something.
                    Young people-purposeful living means you focus on what is good for you. Do not follow what the world dictates for you.
                    Families that have not fully given their lives to God.
                    You walk in the home and you see darkness, stalled buildings, and rudeness from children!
                    It is not yourself, it is the devil who we need to refuse with all authority. 
                </p>
                <p>We have to refuse the spirit of stagnation. We have to refuse it in Jesus’ name and claim the prosperity that God promised. We live in a world of ill motives! 
                    We need to stand firm and be focused for us to impactful.
                    Live today as if you will never live again!
                </p>
                <p><b>AMEN</b></p>
