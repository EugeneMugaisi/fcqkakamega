            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p>The Kakamega Friends meeting started sometime in the late 60’s. Those who were working in the government offices 
                and had come from various places had no place to fellowship therefore had to fellowship in other churches especially 
                in the Anglican Church of Kenya (A.C.K) When they found out that they were a reasonable number, they started meeting 
                in each other’s homes. When the number increased, those who were working in the county council offices asked for space 
                in a nursery school nearby which was given to various groups at different times. They confirmed to worship there as the 
                numbers increased. They then went to apply for a plot from the county council and it is the plot on which the church 
                currently sits on that was given. The next step was the plan to build the church in which members gave priority. 
                They started giving towards the construction of the church through material and money form. They even sought assistance 
                from the rest of the friends family in Kenya. The construction was finished and the church was officially opened in the 
                year 1981. Most of the members started fellowshipping in this church and it gave birth to other meetings around Kakamega 
                town. It was given the Monthly Meeting status with other far away Village Meeting forming the lower meetings.
